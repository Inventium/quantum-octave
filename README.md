# General info

```QuantumOctave``` is a set of GNU Octave functions for doing simulations of
quantum computers (ie. finite-dimensional quantum systems).

# Installation

To use quantum-octave you need [GNU Octave](http://www.octave.org/) or [MathWorks Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).


Package was tested with GNU Ocatve versions 3.1 and some function may not work
with older version of GNU Octave.

Package source code can be downloaded from Github

```
git clone git@github.com:ZKSI/quantum-octave.git
```

In GNU Octave use ```addpath``` to use the package

```
addpath <download-dir>/quantum-octave/src
```

Alternatively you can start Octave in the ```<download-dir>/quantum-octave```
directory where ```.octaverc``` file is located.
